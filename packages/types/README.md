# @zeitgeistpm/types

The types package contains the generated types for the Zeitgeist chain.
Types are generated by first defining them in the [types-def](../type-def)
package, then running some scripts from the root of the monorepo.

## Generating Types

Any time that you update types in types-def, you will need to generate the new
types in this package.

First you will need to run a local instance of the new runtime for which the types
have changed.

```zsh
# build zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist
make build-wasm
make build
make restart
```

Once you have an instance of the chain running, you can run some scripts from the root
of this monorepo (make sure you have the RPC port 9933 exposed! this is on by default):

```zsh
# gets metadata from the locally running chain
yarn types:getMetadata
yarn types:generate
```

And you're done! Now time to make a new release and/or fix anything that's broken in
the SDK!
